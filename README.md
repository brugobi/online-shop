# Capstone Project: Online-shop


This project is about building a webpage based on an online shop for electronics using HTML and CSS. Design idea by Mohammed Awad on Behance and you can check out on this link (https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX). Based on the mentioned template I decided to customize it and build a board game store. There are two pages: the main one and the search result one, each of them has versions for 2 different screen sizes: 

- mobile: up to 768px
- tablet & desktop: from 768px

## desktop version (main page and search page)
